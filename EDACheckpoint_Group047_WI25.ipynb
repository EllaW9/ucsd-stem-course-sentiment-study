    "When students at UCSD register for courses on WebReg each quarter, we often rely on Course and Professor Evaluations (CAPEs) to make our decisions. This online evaluation provides us insight on various aspects of a course, such as instructor, workload, and expected vs. received grades. One of the key categories within CAPE is the recommendation rate of the class, which is the percentage of students who would recommend a course to others. However, it remains unclear which factors have the most significant impact on a student’s likelihood of recommending a course.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we aim to analyze the correlation between CAPE recommendation rates and other CAPEs factors, such as instructor ratings, expected vs. received grades, study hours per week, and overall course enrollment. This can help us better select the courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this past project shown in Reference #1, a group of UCSD students in COGS108 conducted research on past CAPE data, focusing on identifying the key factors that influence the average GPA of a class at UCSD. Their study explored correlations between expected and actual GPAs, study time, class/professor evaluations, and GPA trends across different fields and course levels. One of their notable findings was that upper-division classes tend to have higher average GPAs than lower-division classes, challenging common assumptions about course difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "While their project primarily aimed to understand GPA predictors and their implications for university policies, our research takes a different approach by focusing on the factors that influence students' likelihood of recommending a class in CAPEs. Instead of analyzing the average GPA received by students, we examine the recommendation rate of a class to understand what aspects contribute to a positive course evaluation. However, like their study, our research also relies on CAPE survey data, making their findings a relevant reference for understanding broader academic trends at UCSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies in Reference #2 have explored various aspects of student course selection. Dahl et al. (2022) examined how student attitudes towards the class, class recommendation rate, and perceived behavioral control impact their decision to enroll in a course. This provides a similar approach to our question, what factors influenced the class recommendation rate. It aligns with our hypothesis that instructor quality, expected workload, and grading play a major role in student's satisfication. \n",
