    "\n",
    "The factors that may influence the likelihood of students recommending a class include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructor Quality: A high percentage of students recommending the instructor suggests a strong correlation between instructor effectiveness and class recommendation rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Course Difficulty: The average number of hours spent studying per week may impact student satisfaction. A class requiring excessive study hours might lower recommendations unless students find it worthwhile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grade Expectations vs. Actual Grades: If students receive a lower-than-expected GPA, they may be less likely to recommend the course, possibly due to perceived grading difficulty or misalignment with expectations. Conversely, if students receive a higher-than-expected GPA, they may be more likely to recommend the course, suggesting that grading leniency or clear grading criteria contribute to positive experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Evaluations Made:  A low number of evaluations may lead to biased recommendations, while a higher number could reflect a more accurate consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrollment Size: A larger class size may impact the quality of instruction, student engagement, and overall satisfaction, affecting recommendation rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Term and Course Context: Certain courses or terms might naturally have higher or lower recommendation rates due to factors like course content, teaching methods, or seasonal challenges."

Though not perfect, the **UCSD-Historical-Enrollment dataset combined with CAPEs and SETs** gives us the key variables—final grades, recommendation rates, professors, and course details—needed to explore how student satisfaction relates to academic performance. While it’s currently the most suitable dataset we’ve found from UCSD’s official sources, it does have limitations: missing or incomplete data entries, low evaluation response rates, and challenges linking individual grades to specific evaluations. Nonetheless, it remains our most viable option for investigating these relationships."

    "In our data science project, ethical considerations and privacy protction are integrated into every phase of our process—from the initial formulation of unbiased and inclusive research questions to the transparent communication of our findings. We ensure that our data collection practices adhere to ethical standards by verifying privacy policies and confirming that the datasets do not favor or exclude specific populations. During analysis, we actively apply statistical tests and fairness metrics to detect any biases, and we are prepared to mitigate these through methods such as re-sampling or incorporating additional data sources. We also take stringent measures to protect sensitive information by anonymizing or aggregating data, ensuring full compliance with legal and usage terms. Utilizing established guidelines like UCSD’s Ethics Checklist provsion, our team maintains ongoing oversight and open communication to promptly address emerging ethical issues, ultimately striving to produce research that is both equitable and transparent."
