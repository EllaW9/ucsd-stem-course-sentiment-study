    "When students at UCSD register for courses on WebReg each quarter, we often rely on Course and Professor Evaluations (CAPEs) to make our decisions. This online evaluation provides us insight on various aspects of a course, such as instructor, workload, and expected vs. received grades. One of the key categories within CAPE is the recommendation rate of the class, which is the percentage of students who would recommend a course to others. However, it remains unclear which factors have the most significant impact on a student’s likelihood of recommending a course.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we aim to analyze the correlation between CAPE recommendation rates and other CAPEs factors, such as instructor ratings, expected vs. received grades, study hours per week, and overall course enrollment. This can help us better select the courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this past project shown in Reference #1, a group of UCSD students in COGS108 conducted research on past CAPE data, focusing on identifying the key factors that influence the average GPA of a class at UCSD. Their study explored correlations between expected and actual GPAs, study time, class/professor evaluations, and GPA trends across different fields and course levels. One of their notable findings was that upper-division classes tend to have higher average GPAs than lower-division classes, challenging common assumptions about course difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "While their project primarily aimed to understand GPA predictors and their implications for university policies, our research takes a different approach by focusing on the factors that influence students' likelihood of recommending a class in CAPEs. Instead of analyzing the average GPA received by students, we examine the recommendation rate of a class to understand what aspects contribute to a positive course evaluation. However, like their study, our research also relies on CAPE survey data, making their findings a relevant reference for understanding broader academic trends at UCSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies in Reference #2 have explored various aspects of student course selection. Dahl et al. (2022) examined how student attitudes towards the class, class recommendation rate, and perceived behavioral control impact their decision to enroll in a course. This provides a similar approach to our question, what factors influenced the class recommendation rate. It aligns with our hypothesis that instructor quality, expected workload, and grading play a major role in student's satisfication. \n",

    "The **CAPE dataset** contains student evaluations of university courses from **2020, 2021, and 2022**, capturing key insights into instructor effectiveness, course difficulty, and student workload. Each row represents a specific course-section taught by an instructor in a given term (e.g., FA22 for Fall 2022) and includes metrics such as enrollment numbers, evaluation counts, and recommendation percentages for both the course and instructor. Additionally, it records students' reported study hours per week and their expected vs. received GPA. Missing values in the **`avg_grade_rec`** column, originally represented as `-1`, have been removed to ensure data accuracy. With proper analysis, this dataset can be used to study student's staisfactory scores towards different courses over time."

    "In our data science project, ethical considerations and privacy protection are integrated into every phase of our process—from the initial formulation of unbiased and inclusive research questions to the transparent communication of our findings. We ensure that our data collection practices adhere to ethical standards by verifying privacy policies and confirming that the datasets do not favor or exclude specific populations. During analysis, we actively apply statistical tests and fairness metrics to detect any biases, and we are prepared to mitigate these through methods such as re-sampling or incorporating additional data sources. We also take stringent measures to protect sensitive information by anonymizing or aggregating data, ensuring full compliance with legal and usage terms. Utilizing established guidelines like UCSD’s Ethics Checklist provision, our team maintains ongoing oversight and open communication to promptly address emerging ethical issues, ultimately striving to produce research that is both equitable and transparent."
